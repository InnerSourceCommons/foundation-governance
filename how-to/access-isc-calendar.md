The InnerSource Commons Foundation has a [public Google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_62694f414055ac569e5cb12dafbb0890ca22f3640b177a4b10b53171fbc9bdd4%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FChicago) that people can use to schedule events in the InnerSource Commons.
If you want to use the calendar, then you can request access from [@russ] for your Google account.
After you have access, the InnerSource Commons Calendar should show up in your list of available calendars in the Google Calendar UI.
