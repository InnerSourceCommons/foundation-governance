#Introduction to adding calendar events to our public calendar

The InnerSource Commons Foundation has a public [Google calendar] that people can use to view and schedule events in the InnerSource Commons [website](https://innersourcecommons.org/calendar/).
If you want to add an InnerSource event to our public calendar, you can request access by posting a message in the [#google-admins] Slack channel.
The InnerSource Commons Public Calendar is for public events.
The InnerSource Commons Private Calendar is for private events and should only be used by Foundation members.
We expect that most events in the InnerSource Commons will be public.

When creating events, be sure that your title is clear to anyone that reads it and doesn't contain some special jargon that is only understandable to people that are already in your group.

Please follow this guidance when adding a new event to the calendar:

1. Many people merge their InnerSource Calendar events with their other calendars, so please start the **title of your meeting or event** with 'ISC' (for InnerSource Commons).
2. Remove any other abbreviations or jargon from the **title of your event** 
3. Add date, time
4. If you're having an online meeting, then please add the zoom link, eventbrite/registration link or how to access the meeting in the **where** section of the calendar notice
5. The **meeting description** should be very clear:
   - **Your first sentence should state whether the meeting/event is open to everyone or if it is open to people with an interest in a specific aspect of InnerSource.** 
   - **Your next sentence should give a general description of the group.** 

## Example 1 - Community Calls
