# Introduction

Welcome! We are delighted that you are considering organizing a Gathering event in your region. Gatherings provide an excellent opportunity to maximize your impact. They create a space where people in your area can come together and discuss various topics centered around InnerSource.

So, what exactly is a "Gathering"?
There are actually several formats available. Someone might initiate a small Gathering with just a few people, or you might plan a medium-sized event with dozens of participants alongside your colleagues - planning together is a fantastic opportunity to build unity, and we can achieve more when we're Better Together! Perhaps you're even considering hosting a large-scale hybrid conference starting from your company, with hundreds or potentially thousands of participants! Of course, you can also create your own format. That's wonderful!
This guide will continue to grow. Please share your learnings from your regional experiences.

If you have any questions, please ask in the #local-community channel. Or ask Yuki [yuki@innersourcecommons.org] for help!
The Local Community Working Group is here to support you.

## Choose Your Format

InnerSource Gatherings come in several formats.
Let's look at three primary packages:

1. **Micro Gathering**: Small-scale (few people), casual meetups, spontaneously organized
Similar to gatherings in Germany and France. <https://gatherings.innersourcecommons.org/reports/paris-2024/>
2. **Community Meetup**: Medium-scale (dozens to 100 people), team-organized, community-building focused
Like Tokyo's InnerSource Gathering. See the report here: <https://gatherings.innersourcecommons.org/tokyo-2024/report-isgt2024/>
3. **Summit Conference**: Large-scale (hundreds to thousands), hybrid format, structured organizational approach
Like Shenzhen's InnerSource Summit. See the report here: <https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/summary-innersource-gathering-shenzhen-2024-%E4%B8%AD%E6%84%8F-%E8%B0%AD-a5hkc/?trackingId=nQ04igJ7TgKw2jztAwR0TA%3D%3D>

In essence, Micro Gatherings are small-group meetings, Community Meetups are medium-sized gatherings, and Summit Conferences are large-scale events.
Let's compare these formats briefly. Your core focus remains the same regardless of the style:
enabling participants to connect, expanding your network, sharing knowledge, and growing InnerSource.
The smaller the gathering, the more unified and intimate the connections become.
The larger the gathering, the more opportunity to introduce InnerSource and your activities to a broader audience.

However, logistics vary significantly:

| Item | Micro Gathering | Community Meetup | Summit Conference |

## About Sponsorship

When starting an InnerSource Gathering, you may need to seek sponsors. Sponsors are entities that provide necessary resources for hosting the event, such as venues, meals, swags, and operational support. However, not all of these are mandatory - you can select what's appropriate for your objectives.

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
|Venue| We recommend using free venues or spaces that can be covered by participation fees. Companies sometimes offer their spaces free of charge. Corporate venues often have better AV equipment. Try reaching out to InnerSource practitioners in your area to see if they can provide a venue. Accessibility should be a priority.|
|Meals| While meals aren't mandatory, they can enhance networking, especially with social gatherings and refreshments. For micro-gatherings, participants might share small costs. Post-event visits to bars or cafes are also viable options. For medium to large gatherings, we recommend arranging meals based on confirmed attendance numbers. Consider seeking food sponsors. The key is fostering connections - it doesn't need to be extravagant. Also consider providing water during the event if sponsorship allows.|
|Swags| Enhance engagement with InnerSource t-shirts, stickers, and other merchandise. While you can seek sponsors for original goods, contact the Foundation for speaker or staff shirts. While we can't provide items for all participants, the Foundation may offer support and can provide stickers - please reach out to discuss.|
|Operations| Operational tasks include venue arrangements, schedule coordination, speaker recruitment, participant recruitment, and communication. Without sponsors, these responsibilities fall to the organizing team. For larger events, especially on the day, you'll need support for event recording, online streaming, speaker support, and other logistics. We recommend securing multiple staff members for medium to large gatherings. Consider offering special sponsor tracks in exchange for operational support.|
|Others| Consider providing whiteboards, easels, markers, sticky notes, or name tags. Companies often have these materials, so check with potential sponsors first. If unavailable, contact the Foundation - we may be able to cover minor expenses!|

We recommend hosting Gatherings free of charge. However, you may charge a modest participation fee if necessary for meals or venue costs. When collecting fees, clearly communicate this to participants with proper justification.

Most importantly, treat sponsors with respect. Express gratitude during presentations for venue providers and other support. Display logos appropriately, but always obtain permission first. Consider offering sponsor tracks where they can promote their InnerSource initiatives and related cultural aspects.

## Regarding Event Costs

We recommend hosting Gatherings free of charge. Historically, many Gatherings have been free, as this is the simplest approach with the lowest barrier to entry and minimal administrative overhead.

However, you may charge modest participation fees when necessary for meals or venue costs. Consider the following ticket types:

[Example]
- Student Ticket $0
- Community Ticket $0
- Early Bird Ticket $40 (for corporate participants)
- Enterprise Ticket $80 (for corporate participants)

Tailor ticket types to participant backgrounds and consider regional pricing norms. Remember, Gatherings shouldn't be profit-driven. When charging fees, communicate clearly with participants about the reasoning. Aim to balance expenses and revenue for smooth future operations.

For corporate-run events, consider pooling any surplus for future gatherings.

Note that financial handling and participation fee approaches may vary by region - these are guidelines rather than strict rules.

## Handling Financial Matters

When you secure sponsors, you may need to consider how to handle financial transactions.
If you're organizing the event as a company, this might not be a significant concern. You can follow standard business-to-business event protocols that you're familiar with.
However, if you're an passionate individual managing a Gathering,
we recommend choosing methods that minimize direct financial transactions.

Again, please note that financial handling practices may vary by region and culture. The information provided here is merely exemplary.
Nevertheless, it's crucial to take all possible precautions to avoid financial complications.

For instance, you might be able to secure a corporate venue free of charge. Similarly, food expenses can be directly paid by sponsoring companies to avoid money handling.
However, when using external venues or when circumstances require fund consolidation,
one idea is to use invoice-based payments directed to companies. This eliminates direct money handling as companies pay vendors directly.
Another approach is to partner with an agile, independent vendor as an "operations sponsor" to handle financial transactions.
This transforms individual-to-company transactions into business-to-business dealings, streamlining financial operations and clarifying financial responsibilities.

In cases where credit card transactions or cash handling becomes necessary, and when an operations sponsor isn't available or when collecting funds is required, it's essential to exercise caution with financial management.
In such cases, please consult with the Foundation.
If you're collecting money through advance ticket sales, you can use Foundation-provided platforms like Eventbrite and process reimbursements.
Similarly, the Foundation can receive corporate sponsorship packages and settle payments to your personal account, including issuing invoices when necessary. Please contact the Foundation for details.

While there are various other possible approaches, and we encourage flexible implementation,
the Foundation aims to avoid concentrating responsibility on specific individuals.
Additionally, personal receipt of funds may raise tax implications and liability issues.
While the Foundation will support you in various aspects, we may not be able to assume legal responsibilities.
Therefore, please consult with the Foundation in advance when financial transactions are involved.
Also, please reach out to the Foundation if any issues arise.

## Website Guidelines

We recommend using the Foundation's Eventbrite or local event platforms.
For medium to large-scale Gatherings, we also recommend creating a website with detailed information.

The website can include event overview, schedule, access information, sponsors, organizing team members, and contact information.
We recommend hosting at gatherings.innersourcecommons.org.
Foundation members can support with initial setup, though you'll need to provide the content. Being open source, you can also add content yourself.

However, for micro-gatherings, a website might not be necessary.
In such cases, using event registration sites like Eventbrite is recommended.
The Foundation maintains its own page where your event can be listed, helping to reach a broader audience.

Please prioritize using preferred local platforms when available.
You can also operate with a web-posted announcement page while using Eventbrite for registration.
Feel free to flexibly choose and consult about options that best suit your regional context.

## How to Find Speakers

There are several ways to find speakers:

- Participants or organizers voluntarily become speakers
- Use CFP (Call for Papers) to recruit speakers
- Invite subject matter experts (unpaid)
- Invite subject matter experts (paid)

CFP is a process for recruiting speakers. It's an essential process for finding speakers in medium to large-scale gatherings such as Community Meetups and Summit Conferences. You can use platforms like Google Forms to recruit speakers. We recommend collecting information such as the speaker's name, affiliation, topic, and profile.

However, for micro-gatherings, participants often voluntarily become speakers. In regions where InnerSource is still emerging, it might be challenging to recruit speakers through CFP due to limited practitioners. It's important to maintain flexibility in your approach.

You can also invite subject matter experts. If there are experts in fields intersecting with InnerSource in your region, consider reaching out to them. For non-profit events, they might be willing to speak pro bono or offer non-profit rates. In case of paid speaking engagements, please refer to the financial handling section below.

## About Networking

Networking is crucial. It's about connecting participants, expanding your network, sharing learnings, and growing InnerSource. While seminar-style events are important, we recommend allocating time for networking.

For smaller events, starting with participant introductions is recommended. For medium to large-scale events, dedicated networking sessions are advisable.

If alcohol is culturally acceptable in your region, it can serve as a good conversation starter :)
However, moderation is essential. Encourage adherence to the Code of Conduct, aiming for a friendly yet professional gathering atmosphere.

## About Chatham House Rule

InnerSource Gatherings aim to create an environment where all participants can speak freely. Therefore, implementing the Chatham House Rule is important. This rule states that participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s) may be revealed.

InnerSource covers fascinating topics, from cultural transformation in large enterprises to silo reduction, and even detailed discussions about transfer pricing. The more crucial the content, the more valuable it becomes for everyone. Please consider implementing the Chatham House Rule to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing.

## Code of Conduct

InnerSource Gatherings aim to provide a safe and respectful environment for all participants. Therefore, establishing a Code of Conduct is crucial. The Foundation provides a Code of Conduct template that you can utilize.

## Regarding Event Dates

Choose any date that works!
Different regions may have varying preferences for weekdays or weekends.
Let's decide based on the type of gathering you're planning.

- If you're gathering corporate employees in their official capacity, hosting during weekday business hours or like starting from 3PM allows you to position it as a "formal event." Since InnerSource discussions often involve "changing corporate culture," it's recommended to host it in an official capacity so attendees can bring back event reports and promote organizational transformation.
- If you're targeting a more casual community gathering, hosting after business hours or on weekends might attract more participants.

Weekend tech events may be challenging in some regions due to cultural or religious considerations. It's crucial to select dates that align with your local context.

Another important consideration is scheduling around other events.
There are various conferences like All Things Open, OSCON, Open Source Summit, Fossdem, Fossasia, and other symposiums.
Some people might hesitate to travel solely for an InnerSource gathering.
When these events are held locally, scheduling your InnerSource gathering before or after them could increase attendance.
Additionally, these major events attract various professionals, which could be advantageous for recruiting speakers and participants.
Consider potential partnerships with these events as well.

## Available Resources and Tips

### Gathering Best Practices

A Gathering can become a cohesive space for your community.
Indeed, choosing a smaller meeting room to create an intimate community atmosphere is an excellent strategy.
Large rooms can lead to dispersed discussions.
Smaller venues often facilitate closer connections among participants.
