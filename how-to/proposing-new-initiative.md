So you have a great new idea for InnerSource Commons \- fantastic \- we hope this document helps you navigate through the process to do something new in the community. 

# Background And Context

At the InnerSource Commons we welcome both new contributions and new contributors. For the most, contributions come in familiar forms (e.g. writing a new pattern or a new presentation for a community call). Every now and then, we get a proposal from someone to do something really new. To help keep the community evolving, we want to be a place where new ideas can be explored and supported.

However, though we may have an exciting new proposal, everyone (both those proposing the idea and those who want to support it) may be less sure of how to proceed to turn an idea into reality. This document is intended to help progress new ideas and proposals in the best way possible. 

## A framework to help us with new proposals

The [Cynefin framework](https://cynefin.io) helps us make sense of different kinds of situations. Some are **clear**—the relationship between cause and effect is obvious, and the next step is common sense or best practice, an example might be a new pattern proposal. Some are **complicated**—they might need some expert help from either new contributors or experience members of the InnerSource Commons, but they’re ultimately knowable. An example might be proposing a new local meet-up. Other proposals may be **complex**—there’s no clear path forward, and the only way to understand what might work is to try something and learn from what happens.

So how do you know if you’re dealing with complexity? A few signs: there are many interconnected factors or dependencies, outcomes are hard to predict, and people might see the same situation in different ways. In these cases, it’s usually best not to go all in on one big decision. Instead, we try **safe-to-fail experiments**—small steps we take knowing they might not work, but if they don't, the consequences are manageable.

In a community like InnerSource Commons, a good safe-to-fail experiment is something people can test in the real world, without needing permission from everyone or risking burnout. It should be **small, visible, low-cost**, and ideally something that can generate learning no matter what the outcome is.

# Steps to Explore New Proposals

Let’s start by documenting the new proposal, so it can be shared asynchronously with those that might be able to give feedback and/or support. This early proposal document can be most easily shared as a Google doc, where interested parties can comment, give feedback and ask questions. 

Here's what to include:

### The goals

* What is the scope of the proposal?   
* What are the goals?   
* In what timeframe?   
* Who does it impact? (Profile, scope, scale)  
* How reversible is the impact? (e.g. the proposal relates to a new website structure, but community prefers the old one, can we revert?)

### The benefits

* Who does this proposal benefit? Please be as specific as possible "all InnerSource Commons practitioners" is very broad - try to be as explicit about who it benefits, and how it benefits them.
* How can we tell if it succeeds in meeting goals? How will know we have succeeded?

### The people involved

* Provide background of those proposing the idea, including the experience or context they are bringing.  
* Include experience with InnerSource, InnerSource Commons, and proposed plan (e.g. event management experience if the proposal is about a new event type).   
* Is there support needed? From the foundation? From the community?   
* What are the pathways for others in the community to be involved?

### The cost

* What will this cost \- in time, energy, money?
  * To whom? Volunteers? InnerSource Commons staff?
  * What are the differences between upfront set-up costs, and ongoing sustaining costs?   
* How does it align with current InnerSource Commons priorities? 

### The risk

* Is this a brand new idea? Or has it been done somewhere else? Are there unknowns for implementing this in our context?  
* What’s unclear or uncertain? What might surprise us?   
* Who has reviewed to help consider unforeseen factors?

### Next Steps

* If this is wildly successful, what is required to sustain and/or scale it?  
* If this doesn’t fly, what are the consequences?  
* And most importantly \- what might we all learn, no matter the outcome?

# Communicating Your Proposal

Once you have documented your idea, the best next step is to get some feedback from others in InnerSource Commons. They will likely questions to help clarify your idea and they will be able to help advise how best to proceed. 

Don’t know how to reach someone in InnerSource Commons? Just ask in Slack\! Use the appropriate channel (e.g. patterns channel for pattern-related proposals), or if it is a brand new area, ask in the general channel.  

# Designing Safe-to-fail Experiments (at InnerSource Commons)

Once there is a complete overview of the new proposal, the next step is to design a safe-to-fail experiment to test assumptions. If you don’t have in-depth knowledge about how the Commons operates, InnerSource Commons staff will be on hand to help advise and give additional InnerSource Commons context at this stage. 

Here are some steps to shape a first safe-to-fail experiment at InnerSource Commons:

1. **Start small.** What’s the simplest, smallest version of this idea you can try? Aim for something you can test without needing a big budget, team-wide agreement, or months of planning.  
2. **Be clear about what you’re testing.** What’s the question you’re trying to answer? What’s the assumption you’re probing? The goal isn’t to “succeed”- it’s to *learn*.  
3. **Define what ‘good enough’ looks like.** How will you know if it’s working? What signs would tell you it’s not? Keep your indicators light and observable \- something others can see too.  
4. **Set a timebox.** Don’t let it drag on forever. Set a check-in point: a week, a month, whatever makes sense \- just enough time to see if anything interesting is emerging.   
5. **Think through cost and support needed. Who needs to be aware or loosely involved?** Who might help make it happen or notice the effects? What are the dependencies in terms of people, processes, tech, cost (time, money, attention)? Are these community dependencies or foundation dependencies?  
6. **Consider the consequences.** What happens if it doesn’t go well? What might be the consequences? What happens if it goes extremely well \- can we handle the success? Think about too many people turning up to an event, for example. Ideally there are no major risks, no irreversible changes as a result of our experiement.  
7. **Think through next steps.** Have simple next steps thought out to amplify / dampen the experiment. Say it goes extremely well \- what you would do next to scale the initiative. Also, in case the idea does not deliver what we all hoped, have an idea about how you might gracefully stop the experiment with the least effort.   
8. **Share the story.** Let others know what you’re trying, why, and how. Frame it as an experiment. Invite curiosity. Share your story somewhere like GitHub where we can find it forever (not just in Slack). Whether experiments fly or flop, others can learn from your experience.

Designing experiments this way helps a community stay open, creative, and resilient. It’s not about getting it right \- it’s about experimenting with what’s possible for the best possible outcomes for the community.
