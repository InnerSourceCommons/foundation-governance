This document describes our contracted staff and their roles at the Foundation.

# Relationship to Community Participants

Our [strategy document](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/foundation/blob/master/STRATEGY.md) describes the relationship between our staff and community.

"*... work needs to come from the InnerSource Commons lay members and participants. Our paid staff supports and amplifies their work. This support looks like setting up technical or social infrastructure (e.g. Slack, events, shoutouts, swag) and running repeatable programs and technology (e.g. community calls, website), but new content and the definition of new programs needs to come from the lay membership.*"

# Relationship to One Another

Each staff person has areas of work in the Foundation where they lead in implementation and support.
That person should feel special dedication to excellence in that area.
That said, _all_ staff should do their best to understand, give feedback, and be willing to pitch in and work on any aspect of work that the Foundation needs done from its staff.
The annual summit, being the Foundation's largest single activity, receives attention, dedication, and leadership from all staff.
