This document describes our hired staff and their roles at the Foundation.

Our [strategy document](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/foundation/blob/master/STRATEGY.md) describes the relationship between our staff and community.



work needs to come from the InnerSource Commons lay members and participants. Our paid staff supports and amplifies their work. This support looks like setting up technical or social infrastructure (e.g. Slack, events, shoutouts, swag) and running repeatable programs and technology (e.g. community calls, website), but new content and the definition of new programs needs to come from the lay membership. This is our financial reality and, frankly, we expect content from lay members to be of better quality
